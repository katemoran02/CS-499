Enhancement One
Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
Artifact Overview
The artifact I selected is a Java-based contact management service named ContactService, initially created for an earlier course in the Computer Science program. The original version was a back-end logic module that supported basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a HashMap to store contact objects in memory. Each contact contained fields such as contactId, firstName, lastName, phone, and address.
This artifact was created during the early stages of the program and primarily focused on practicing object-oriented principles and exception handling. While functionally sound, it lacked a user interface and required interaction through hardcoded test cases or the console.
Justification for ePortfolio Inclusion
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my foundational understanding of software design and object-oriented development. More importantly, the enhancement I made — integrating a JavaFX graphical user interface (GUI) — elevates the project to a user-friendly application, reflecting a deeper proficiency in software engineering principles.
This enhancement showcases several skills:
•	Event-driven programming: Implemented JavaFX button click events and data-binding to GUI fields.
•	UI/UX considerations: Designed a simple yet functional layout for ease of use.
•	Code modularity: Preserved separation between UI and service logic (e.g., ContactService remains independent).
•	Error handling and validation: Included safeguards for invalid inputs or duplicate contact IDs.
These improvements are representative of the kind of full-stack engineering responsibilities I hope to take on in the industry. Adding a GUI shows my ability to make a solution more accessible and production-ready.
Course Outcomes Addressed
Yes, the enhancement meets the outcomes I planned to target in Module One. Specifically, I’ve demonstrated the ability to:
•	Design and evaluate computing solutions using computer science practices by architecting a more usable system through a modular design.
•	Use innovative techniques and tools (JavaFX in this case) to deliver a solution that meets real-world usability expectations.
•	Deliver technically sound and visually coherent communication, evidenced by the intuitive layout and clear labeling within the GUI.
No updates are needed for the outcome-coverage plan — the enhancement aligns well with the originally planned learning goals.
Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Throughout the enhancement, I learned a great deal about GUI development in Java, including layout management with GridPane, form event handling, and integrating service layers with user-facing components. This process helped me deepen my understanding of software architecture by enforcing clear boundaries between the UI and logic layers.
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring data consistency between the form inputs and the underlying data model. For example, I had to prevent users from adding empty fields or reusing existing contact IDs — errors that would’ve been harder to catch without a structured UI. Additionally, I learned how to handle state transitions smoothly in the UI, such as populating fields when a user loads a contact to update.
Overall, this enhancement helped me think more deeply about software from a user's perspective. It pushed me to develop not just code that works, but code that works well and is easy to use. This is the essence of good software engineering.
