# CS-499: Computer Science Capstone

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains enhanced artifacts developed for the CS-499 Capstone course. Each artifact reflects growth in a key area of computer science, including software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design. Enhancements were made to improve usability, scalability, and maintainability, and to demonstrate mastery of core program outcomes.

## 🧩 Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

### 🔍 Artifact Overview

The original artifact is a Java-based contact management service (`ContactService`) that performed basic CRUD operations using a `HashMap`. It contained key fields like `contactId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `phone`, and `address`, and focused on object-oriented programming and exception handling.

### ✅ Justification for Inclusion

This artifact highlights foundational design skills, and the enhancement — a **JavaFX GUI** — transformed it into a more complete, user-friendly application. Key skills demonstrated:

- Event-driven programming with JavaFX
- UI/UX layout considerations
- Modularity and separation of concerns
- Input validation and error handling

These improvements represent my growth into a full-stack mindset and align with industry expectations.

### 🎯 Course Outcomes Addressed

- Designed modular systems with a user-centric architecture.
- Applied JavaFX to build interactive and intuitive interfaces.
- Communicated effectively through visual design and code organization.

### 🔁 Reflection

Developing the GUI improved my understanding of architecture and usability. I faced challenges ensuring data consistency, managing input validation, and linking UI elements with backend logic. These experiences gave me a deeper appreciation of the user's perspective in software development.

## 🧮 Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

### 🔍 Artifact Description

The original artifact was a CRUD-based `ContactService` implemented in Java, storing contacts in a `HashMap`.

### ✅ Why I Selected This Artifact

It was ideal for algorithmic enhancement — specifically, I added **undo/redo functionality** using stack data structures. This mirrors features seen in modern software editors and showcases algorithmic problem-solving in a real-world context.

### 🛠️ Enhancement Summary

- Introduced `undoStack` and `redoStack` to track state changes.
- Implemented deep copies and added a copy constructor to preserve integrity.
- Maintained separation of concerns and easy extensibility.

### 🔍 Skills Demonstrated

- Stack-based state management
- Object immutability and deep copying
- Logical design tradeoffs and clean abstractions

### 🎯 Course Outcome Alignment

> *“Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and standards while managing trade-offs.”*

### 🔁 Reflection

This enhancement deepened my appreciation for immutability and state control. I overcame challenges related to deep-copy logic and learned how to create safer, more reliable systems.

## 🗃️ Enhancement Three: Database Development

### 🔍 Artifact Overview

The original artifact is a Python module built with `pymongo` to manage animal records in a MongoDB database. It supported CRUD operations and was used in CS 340: Client/Server Development.

### ✅ Justification for Inclusion

To reflect more advanced database skills, I added an **aggregation pipeline** function: `generate_breed_report()`, which summarizes the number of animals by breed. I also implemented:

- Logging and error handling
- Data validation
- Function documentation (docstrings)

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- MongoDB aggregation (`$group`, `$sort`)
- Data reporting and summarization
- Error management and system robustness

### 🎯 Course Outcomes Addressed

- Designed solutions using real-world database operations.
- Applied advanced MongoDB techniques for data analytics.
- Adopted a security-focused and maintainable coding style.

### 🔁 Reflection

I gained a stronger understanding of aggregation syntax and its analytical potential. I faced challenges with edge cases (e.g., missing breed data) and learned to abstract logic for reuse.
